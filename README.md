# LLM Translator
This is a toolkit for LLM translation.

## What is LLM translation?
It's evolving from the old MNT's (Machine Neural Translator models) to using Large Language Models (LLM) as the translating.

# Why?
Because LLM translations are the way to go. This can allow for semantic and syntactic examples to be added to an LLM translation request.

And [read all the research](RESEARCH.md)

# Usage
Each tool is in its own folder and most are command-line interactive tools.

## Tools

1. [TMX Generator](./tmx-generator) - Generates TMX files and/or a CSV for a upload

## Why typescript
Why not? Python can go rest a bit.


# Roadmap
1. Spin up a TMX Vector Database
2. Build more tools
3. Spin-up a self-hosted service to translate
