# LLM Translator

This is a toolkit for LLM translation.

## What is LLM translation?

It's evolving from the old MNT's (Machine Neural Translator models) to using Large Language Models (LLM) as the translator.

## Why?

Because LLM translations are the way to go. This can allow for semantic and syntactic examples to be added to an LLM translation request.
[Read our post about using a Vector TMX Database](https://baobabtech.ai/posts/a-paradigm-shift-in-machine-translation-vector-embeddings-as-translation-memory)

And [read all the research](RESEARCH.md)

## Usage

Each tool is in its own folder and most are command-line interactive tools.

### Tools

1. [TMX Generator](./tmx-generator) - Generates TMX files and/or a CSV for a upload
2. ... more coming soon

### Why typescript

Why not? Python can go rest a bit.

## Roadmap

1. Spin up a TMX Vector Database
2. Build more tools
3. Spin-up a self-hosted service to translate
